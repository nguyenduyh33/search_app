Seach App is possibly the least creative name for an app ever. Fortunately, it does actually search things...specifically eBay listings by keyword. The app uses the eBay finding API in the sandbox environment via an app/client id. It can find just about any test data out there. Duplicate listings, listings without descriptions, a million listings with some variation of the word "test" in the title, you name it! Oh did I mention it has infinite scrolling powered by Flutter? Flutter is really cool.
